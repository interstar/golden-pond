### Goldenpond FL Studio Script

FL Studio allows us to script the Piano Roll with Python. This is VERY cool!

So we've built GoldenPond into such a script.

Simply building the python library using makeall.sh in the haxe/ directory will bring the goldenpond.py here under the name generated.py

Then run make.sh here to add the FL Studio specific code to a final script named goldenpond.pyscript

And copy that to the place FL Studio can find it. Probably  Users/YOURNAME/Documents/Image-Line/FL Studio/Settings/Piano roll scripts/goldenpond.pyscript
