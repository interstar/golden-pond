These are some example programs for using goldenpond

As well as the goldenpond library itself, these examples need external libraries to help deal with sound and midi


### example.py

Requires numpy and sounddevice

```
pip install numpy, sounddevice

python3 example.py"
```

This will generate a chord progression and play it.

### midi_example.py

Requires the pretty_midi library

```
pip install pretty_midi
python3 

```

This generates a file gp_example.mid which can be played in a suitable MIDI player. (I'm using VLC with suitable MIDI extensions)
